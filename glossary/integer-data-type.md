# Integer Data Type
- Integer data type allows a variable to store numeric values
- "int" keyword is used to refer to the integer data type
- The storage size of an int data type is 2 or 4 or 8 bytes
- For 16-bit processor, 2 bytes (16 bit) of memory is allocated for int data type
- For 32-bit processor, 4 bytes of memory is allocated
- For 64-bit processor, 8 bytes of memory is allocated for int data type

**Storage values for integer data types**
- int (2 byte) can store values from -32,768 to +32,767
- int (4 byte) can stor values from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647
- For integer values that cross the above limit, use "long int" and "long long int" for which the limits are very high
