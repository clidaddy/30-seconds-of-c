# 30 Seconds of C 
---
"Curated collection of useful C Programming turorials, snippets, and projects that you can understand in 30 seconds or less."
**Work In Progress**

**Motivation for this project** 
The core goal of **30 seconds of C** is to provide a public record of my journey to learn c programming. It's my goal to provide a quality resource for both beginners and advanced c progammers/developers. My initial motivation for creating this repository was to use it as a tool to document my journey at the [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/) - an engineering and programming. The contents of this repo are designed to help you write real time C programs on your own. 

## Getting Started
**Additional Learning Resources**
If you are new to C Programming(like myself), try taking a look at some of these references 
- ANSI 89 – American National Standards Institute, American National Standard for Information Systems Programming Language C, 1989.
- Kernighan 78 – B. W. Kernighan and D. M. Ritchie, The C Programming Language, Prentice-Hall: Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1978. Second edition, 1988.
- Thinking 90 – C* Programming Guide, Thinking Machines Corp. Cambridge Mass., 1990.

## Inspiration for this project## 
The idea behind 30 Seconds of C was inspired some people who created similar collections in other programming languages and environments. Here are the ones we like the most:

## How to Contribute
Do you have a cool idea for a new snippet? Maybe some code you use often and is not part of our collection? Contributing to 30 seconds of code is as simple as 1,2,3,4!
