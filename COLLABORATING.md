# Collaborator team rules and guidelines for community moderation
---
As a contributor/member of the community, remember that you can always open issues about moderation and problems with how community moderation is done. We are always open to constructive criticism and feedback!
## Responsibilities of a collaborator
---
As a member of the team that manages 30 seconds of C, you have the following responsibilities:
- **Be part of the conversation in the issue tracker.** That includes (but is not limited to) helping out new members, discussing new features and explaining decisions to people.
- **Review pull requests.** You do not have to read through all of the pull requests and review them, but taking the time each day to review a few can help a great deal.
- **Be civil and polite.** If you are about to lose your temper, take a step back and do something else. We want our interactions with the community to be polite so that more people can join the project and contribute in any way they can. Remember to always thank contributors for their help, even if it's minor changes or changes that did not make it into the project. This way we can reward and encourage people to keep being part of the community.
- **Contribute when you want, moderate when you can.** If you have a lot on your plate outside of this project, it's alright. It's better to take a break for a few days rather than hastily deal with issues and pull requests that might break things.
